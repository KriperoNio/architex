# ARchiteX

The first my Flutter project with AR func.

## Attention 

The project has been postponed! Due to the perfection of this technology, Google did not support all phones, in general, devices, which slowed down development, I had to work on a tablet. I guess there are AR cores in addition to Google services for AR, but lack of time, fatigue and the first punch forced the project to be postponed. ðŸ¥²
